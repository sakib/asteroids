-BOSS BATTLE
  Asteroid (player) vs. Planets (enemy)

Story:
You are an asteroid.
But unlike your peers, you are sentient.
You are completely fed up with the Galactic Feds: killing all your friends just because of the trajectories they're born with. The hypocrites exercise Lockeian philosophy but do not hesitate to encroach on your natural rights, 
But no more!
You decide to take things into your own -hands- rocks.
